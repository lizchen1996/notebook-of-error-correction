1.  function 引用的时候带（），attribute不用

# Print the head of the homelessness data
print(homelessness.head())

# Print information about homelessness
print(homelessness.info())

# Print the shape of homelessness
print(homelessness.shape)

Remember that.shape is an attribute, not a function.


2. 选取的行数要和 [] 对数一致
# From high_homelessness_srt, select the state and indiv_per_10k cols
result = high_homelessness_srt[["state","indiv_per_10k"]]
