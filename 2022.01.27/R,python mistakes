1. Draw a sample of a 150 numbers from a normal distribution with a mean of 33 and standard deviation of 3. The random number generator has been seeded for you.
Complete the code to return the output
norm <- rnorm(150, 33, 3)
cat("Sample size: ", length(norm), " Sample mean: ", mean(norm), " Sample SD: ", sd(norm))

Expected Output
Sample size:  150  Sample mean:  32.96224  Sample SD:  2.699927


2. Complete the code to create the plot of the rating variable in the tv_shows data frame.
Complete the code to return the output
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(tv_shows, aes(rating)) + geom_histogram()


3. You have been provided with a bootstrapped sample of mean lap times for Formula 1 race cars, contained as a column seconds in the data frame bootstraps.
Generate a 95% confidence interval conf_int of the bootstrapped lap times.

Select the code to return the output
library(dplyr)

conf_interval <- bootstraps %>%
  summarize(
    lower = quantile(seconds, 0.025),   
    upper = quantile(seconds, 0.975)   
  )

conf_interval


4.Draw a sample of a 1000 numbers from a normal distribution with a mean of 2.5 and standard deviation of 1. The random number generator has been seeded for you.
Complete the code to return the output
my_sample <- sample(1000,2.5,1)

cat("Sample size: ", length(my_sample), " Sample mean: ", mean(my_sample), " Sample SD: ", sd(my_sample))
Expected Output
Sample size:  1000  Sample mean:  2.434645  Sample SD:  0.978228 


5ï¼Œ You are working as a professor and have just administered an exam to your students. Examining the scores,
you find that they follow a normal distribution with a mean score of 71 (out of 100) and a standard deviation of 15.
Given this information, calculate the probability that a student scored above 90.
Complete the code to return the output

pnorm(90, mean = 71, sd = 15, lower.tail = FALSE)
Expected Output
[1] 0.1026373


6. Use a chi-square test to determine if there is a relationship between cycling more than 65 miles per week and experiencing knee pain. 
We will define a casual cyclist as someone who cycles less than 65 miles per week. The dataset has been loaded for you as knee.pain.survey.

            Experience Knee Pain
            |    Yes  |     No
casual      |    430  |    150
non_casual  |   1570  |    760
Complete the code to return the output

chisq.test(knee.pain.survey)

Expected Output

	Pearson's Chi-squared test with Yates' continuity correction

data:  knee.pain.survey
X-squared = 9.5505, df = 1, p-value = 0.001999


7. The wine data frame contains data on the pH value of various wines as well an overall quality rating of each wine. Use a violin plot to compare the pH values of wines in different quality groups.

     pH quality
  <dbl>   <dbl>
1  3.51       5
2  3.2        5
3  3.26       5
Select the code to return the output
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(wine, aes(factor(quality), pH)) + 
  geom_violin() +
  labs(x = "quality",
       y = "pH"
      )


8. You have just performed a t-test to compare the average level of anxiety of people before and after
completing a mindfulness meditation program. Based on the test, you observed a small reduction in mean levels of anxiety after the program, 
ith a p-value of 0.07.

What does this p-value tell you about the results of your study?

there is 7% chance to observe an effect at least as large if the program were ineffective


9. Generate 20 samples from a Poisson distribution with a rate equal to 2.
Complete the code to return the output
set.seed(42)

samples <- rpois(20, 2)
samples
Expected Output
 [1] 4 4 1 3 2 2 3 0 2 3 2 3 4 1 2 4 5 0 2 2
