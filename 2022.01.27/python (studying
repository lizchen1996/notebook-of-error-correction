1. Python Data Types
there's the float, to represent a real number
and the int, to represent an integer. Next,
we also have str, short for string, to represent text in Python
and bool, which can be either True or False. You can save these values as a variable, like these examples show.

2. Problem
the infomation you met in life, such as height, phone-number, click..

3. Python List
3-1 lists can also contain lists themselves.
3-2 A list is a way to give a single name to a collection of values. 
These values, or elements, can have any type; they can be floats, integer, booleans, strings, 
but also more advanced Python types, even lists. It's perfectly possible for a list to contain different types as well.

4. List type
列表里可以包含字符串和数字，先想一想格式，就连逗号都很重要

5. Subsetting lists
5-1 The first element in the list has index 0, the second element has index 1, and so on.
5-2 You can also count backwards, using negative indexes. This is useful if you want to get some elements at the end of your list. 
5-3 To get your dad's height, for example, you'll need the index -1. These are the negative indexes for all list elements.

6. List slicing
从0开始index，连字符串都算，一个一个的
多多print，这样才能确保每一步都是正确取值

7. Changing list elements
可以用新元素直接覆盖

8. delete elements
注意取值范围，括号左闭右开
