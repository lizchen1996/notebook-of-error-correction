1. An eccentric chocolate factory owner has decided to conceal a limited number of special prizes, hidden under the wrapper, in his latest batch of chocolate bars.

Perform a simulation of you purchasing three separate chocolate bars from a local store, sampling from the vector chocolate. The random seed has been set for you.

purchases <- sample(chocolate, 3)

the reason why :  1. no familiar with R  2. cannot translate the problem to the code


2. Create a density plot of the ages (age) of all passengers aboard the titanic.
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(titanic, aes(age)) + geom_density()

3. Below is a boxplot reflecting the the lap times for a sample of Formula 1 race cars (in seconds).
What does the center white box tell you about the lap times?
the reason why:  the ability of interpretation of charts is not good, I need to practice more( find more charts and analyze carefully

4. What can a histogram tell you about a dataset?
the distribution of a continous variable

5. Based on past experience, you know that your website receives approximately 1500 visitors per hour.
Simulate the number of visits per hour for the next six hours.

set.seed(42)
traffic <- rpois(6, 1500)

6. You have access to a dataset with information about the weight and size of a tropical species of fish. 
You want to test the hypothesis that one sub-species is heavier than another. Based on the boxplot below, 
why might you not want to use a t-test?
the data is not normally distributed.

7. A result is said to be statistically significant if:
the outcome is unlikely to have occured due to chance
the reason why :  not familar with statistics

8. Which statement is NOT TRUE about test statistics?
the sample mean and the population mean are examples of test statistics
the reason why: need more caution

9. Draw a sample of 100 numbers from a standard normal distribution. The random number generator has been seeded for you.
Complete the code to return the output

norm <- rnorm(100)
norm[c(1,5:10)]

Expected Output
[1] -1.3850706  1.4255380  0.7444798  0.7002294 -0.2293546  0.1970939  1.2071538

10. An eccentric chocolate factory owner has decided to conceal a limited number of special prizes, hidden under the wrapper,
in his latest batch of chocolate bars.

Perform a simulation of you purchasing three separate chocolate bars from a local store,
sampling from the vector chocolate. The random seed has been set for you.

Complete the code to return the output
purchases <- sample(chocolate, 3)

purchases
Expected Output
[1] "Lose" "Lose" "Win" 

the reason why: not familar with R. (as you know,sometimes I need memorize the rule of R without explanations

11. To get help on the max() function, for example, you can use one of these calls:

help(max)
?max
